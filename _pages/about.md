I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of California San Diego. I recently graduated with a degree in Mathematics from the University of Chicago. My research interests focus on computations in Algebraic Topology.

I post occaisonal talks to my youtube channel, which you can find on the left. I will also be posting periodic blog posts with no schedule for now.
